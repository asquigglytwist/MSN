    Bharatanatyam, is a classical dance form that originated in the Indian temples. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam">Bharatanatyam</a> is known for its grace, purity, tenderness, and sculpturesque poses. Lord Shiva is considered the God of this dance form. A possible origin of the name is from Bharata Muni, who wrote the Natya Shastra. The meaning of the word Bharatnatyam is "Bhavam" means expression, "ragam" meaning music, "thalam" meaning rhythm and natyam meaning dance. Bharata Natyam is considered to be a fire-dance â€” the mystic manifestation of the metaphysical element of fire in the human body. The movements of an authentic Bharata Natyam dancer resemble the movements of a dancing flame.

    In Hindu mythology the whole universe is the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja, a name for Lord Shiva, the Hindu ascetic yogi and divine purveyor of destruction of evil. The symbolism of the dance of Shiva (in the form of Nataraja) is represented by the attitude called "Ananda Tandavam". Also known as the cosmic dancer, he is here the embodiment and manifestation of the eternal energy in five activities (panca-kriya): creation, pouring forth, unfolding; maintenance or duration (sthiti); destruction or taking back (smhara); concealing, veiling, hiding the transcendental essence behind the garb of apparitions (tirobhava); and favoring, bestowing grace through a manifestation that accepts the devotee (anugraha).
