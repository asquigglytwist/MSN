            <div>
                <span class="msncolor">M.S.Natyalaya</span> was founded in 2012 with only two students, to provide training and promote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam">Bharatanatyam</a>. Due to the exceptional quality of training and support, it has seen a tremendous growth since then. In two years we've reached where we currently train over 90 students.
            </div>
            <div>
                Our vision is to offer world-class training to our students, emphasize them to <q>learn</q> Bharatanatyam with interest, dedication and regular practice, <q>express</q> it creatively through various stage performances and thereby <q>grow</q> not only their skills in the art but also contribute significantly in taking the art to next level and passing the knowledge on to the upcoming generation.
            </div>
            <div>
                We follow our own curriculum to provide certifications to students upon completing each level and we are also constantly working towards MoU with prestigious institutions, to provide various certification programs and degrees based on their syllabus.
