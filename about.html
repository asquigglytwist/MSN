                <p class="msncolor" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">M.S.Natyalaya</p> was founded in 2012 with only two students, to provide training and promote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam">Bharatanatyam</a>. Due to the exceptional quality of training and support, it has seen a tremendous growth since then. In two years we've reached where we currently train over 90 students.

            <div>
                Our vision is to offer several degrees of world-class training to our students, so that they learn the fundamentals in-depth and get involved in the art with full devotion and dedication. Having a thorough understanding, they not only excel in dance but also contribute to the development of the art. We are constantly working towards MoU with prestigious institutions, to provide various certification programs and degrees to our students.

                    	Mrs. Kousalya Nivas is basically an engineering postgraduate. She completed her B.Tech in Information Technology in Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, Coimbatore during 2008. She started her career as a Software engineer at Wipro.  Then she switched to teaching profession working as a Lecturer in CMRIT, Bangalore because teaching is her passion. Later, she took a break from work and pursued M.Tech in Computer Networks &amp; Engineering in CMRIT, Bangalore &amp; completed the degree with University topper award during July 2014.  Also, she bagged the “BEST STUDENT” Award for 2007 during  her UG program from amongst the members of ISTE Students Chapter, New Delhi at Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, Coimbatore.
                        
                         Mrs. Kousalya Nivas hopes that as she strives towards greater excellence in dancing, her passion for Bharata Natyam and other forms of art will endow her with courage to break boundaries and widen her horizons in all avenues of life. Her vision is to pass on the varied culture and glorious heritage of this wonderful art to the young and upcoming generation.  To accomplish this, she started her own dance school M.S.NATYALAYA in Marathahalli, Bangalore during 2012. She is training nearly more than 80 students. She has dedicated herself in spreading this beautiful art to the people. She acknowledges her sincere thanks to her Gurus for their expert guidance and her parents &amp; in-laws who have identified and greatly encouraged her in making her dreams a reality. She greatly appreciates her husband and son without whose cooperation and support, pursuing her passion &amp; running this institute would have been impossible.
                         Endowed with a pleasing stage presence, Kousalya Nivas brings to her audience a refreshing presentation of Bharata Natyam, exhibited through her strong sense of rhythm, scintillating nritta and lively abhinaya. Everyone who has seen Kousalya Nivas perform is struck by her unique thought process and fresh approach to dance. While deeply rooted in tradition she has evolved her own individual style without affecting the core principles of Bharata Natyam.

He founded M.S.Natyalaya with an intent to promote Bharatanatyam and preserve the art's heritage. His focus is on quality, discipline and excellence. And he ensures the institute and students manifest them. His dream is to develop the institute into one of the top Arts Academy for Classical Dance and Music.</p>

                        <p>To do his part for the great art-form, he established M.S.Natyalaya effectively utilizing his wife's Bharathanatyam talents, which in-turn helps spread the core values and principles to the younger generations who can nurture it further.</p>
                        
                        <p>He admires the inspirational quote by Swami Vivekananda <q>Each work has to pass through these stages - ridicule, opposition and then acceptance. Those who think ahead of their time are sure to be misunderstood.</q></p>
